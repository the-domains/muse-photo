Hi!
I'm Rebecca Batdorf. A graduate from Indiana University. My degree program is
bachelor of fine arts with a concentration in graphic design. I also studied
photography at The Art Institute and at Ivy Tech State College. After
graduating in 2013 I did several freelance jobs and worked for FWCS in Fort
Wayne. My job at FWCS? Driving school buses! I'm completely proud of that too.
It was great experience and required great responsibility. After driving school
buses, I decided to reenter college for a certificate program to gain an art
k12 teaching certificate. That Is what I am currently pursuing. In the meantime,
I am substitute teaching for FWCS in Fort Wayne. It's great experience toward
my ultimate goal of teaching art to our youth. So far I'm loving it! 

Typically, I don't do photography for clients but I have
occasionally. I do it more for myself and as a way to express myself. I often
do abstract images or double exposure images that express a concept or meaning
for me. I also like images with lots of depth of field. Typically, I prefer
images that have the subject sharp and background faded. I do my best to
utilize rule of thirds but what are rules for if not to break? Especially when
you're just having fun for your own self expression. I hope you enjoy my site.
Please if you like an image and would like to use it? Please make a request and
let me know the purpose and the use. Thanks much!
